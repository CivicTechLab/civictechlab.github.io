  "content": "The “Youth, ICTs, and Political Engagement in Asia” project spanned over two years from 2009 to 2012 and officially closed on November 15, 2012. The five-country (Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, India, Bangladesh) comparative study was funded by [International Development Research Center, Canada](https://idrc.ca/en/homepage) through ideacorp, the Philippines, after a competitive review process. A grant of SGD 170,000 was utilized to conduct 143 in-depth interviews and 41 focus group discussions with young activists. About 35 researchers were recruited, trained, and organized to contribute to this project. The research findings from this project have been published as [a special issue inInternational Communication Gazette](http://gaz.sagepub.com/content/75/3.toc) in April 2013. Before that, the project has been presented as a panel at the 19th Asian Media Information and Communication (AMIC 2011) and the annual conference of International Association of Media and Communication Research (IAMCR 2012). The project was re-invented and continued through an NUS-University of Sydney Partnership Fund during 2019-2021.\n\n[See more details in this Final Technical Report.](</reports/Final Technical Reports.pdf>)\n",
