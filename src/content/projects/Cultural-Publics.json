  "content": "The formation of publics has been re-written by the mediation of information and communication technologies in the era of network society. Cultural publics originated from popular culture fans and celebrities have increasingly taken the center stage of active citizenship. Shared among the diverse groups of nowadays cultural publics are the rooting in cultural identity, and the shaping role played by new media. The logic behind algorithm-driven traffic media, the financial move made by new media companies, and the user communities' negotiation present a complex web of actors in contesting cultural publics.\n\nPolitical culture varies among countries, due to their unique AND interwoven historical trajectories. Public engagement in activities such as political talk, elections, protests must be understood within the time- and location-bounded contexts. Historically, authoritarian orientation is salient in some countries than others; elections are indigenous to some cultures but imported to others; participatory acts, either online or offline, contain widely different meanings. The influence of political culture, even in a digital age, is best made evident if we take a comparative approach to examine the South against the South.\n",
