  "content": "Civic Technology, or Civic Tech, refers to information and communication technologies (ICTs) that facilitate civic engagement. Government-centric Civic Tech refers to governments utilizing the technologies for service provision, citizen consultations, and data analyses to inform policy making. Citizen-centric Civic Tech refers to the platforms and applications that enable citizens to connect and collaborate with each other and with government. Multiple groups of actors have contributed to building and implementing Civic Tech, including governments, academics, NGOs, citizen groups, and more. Yet, at least two gaps exist in the academic scrutiny of the topic:\n\n1. Although Civic Tech is gaining traction in North America and Europe, little has been known about the development in Asia, despite its increasing prominence; and\n2. As an ongoing phenomenon, our understanding is still limited regarding the sources, design, implementation, and evaluation of Civic Tech (e.g., how communities of computer programmers and digital developers play an unprecedented role in this).\n\n![](/home/history.jpeg)\n",
