The CivicTech Lab joined the 2025 Participedia Summer School, co-hosted by Tsinghua University and International University of Japan! 

Our lab director Weiyu Zhang was a teacher and lab member Yuheng Wang was a student. Along with researchers from Australia, China, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, and the UK, our lab shared our recent innovations in deliberation. First, Prof. Zhang presented on the "deliberative co-design" workshops, which focus on the topic of alternative protein foods. Later, Prof. Zhang worked with University of Zurich researchers Francesco Veri, PhD, and Maurice Flechtner to run a workshop comparing human-human, human-AI, and AI-AI deliberation. 

We are excited to see that the international deliberation community is alive and does strive! The next phase of deliberation is to incorporate technologies to enhance the scale and depth of deliberation on globally impactful issues such as AI, climate change, and novel foods. Diverse experiences and practices of deliberation should be the driving force of this new phase!
