We are beyond excited to announce a phenomenal partnership with the NUS Department of Food Science and Technology, Economist Alberto Salvo, Institute for Public Understanding of Risk Director Leonard Lee, and Food Scientist Lai Peng Leong backed by an incredible 5-year long consumer study project from the Bezos Center for Sustainable Protein. It took us almost one full year to get the journey started. 


This collaboration is not just a project; it's a double (social+technological) revolution in sustainable food practices to benefit society and our planet! By integrating scientific insights into public communication and exploring consumer behaviors, we aim to foster a more informed consumer decision-making process and collaborative public discussion. 


Together, we're on a mission to communicate with the public about sustainable protein and redefine the future of food sustainability with multiple stakeholders.


üåü Stay connected as we dive into this groundbreaking journey to transform our world for the better. Here‚Äôs to making a monumental impact! üåç‚ú®
