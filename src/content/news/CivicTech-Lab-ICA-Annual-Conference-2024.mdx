From Gold Coast to Brisbane Australia, the CivicTech Lab had a well-navigated voyage at the annual conference of International Communication Association. We ported between rich and insightful sessions, talked to scholars like guiding lighthouses, and forged collaboration across vibrant sailing routes. 

1. Zhang, W. & Qi, D. (June 25,  2024). Civic Tech as a catalyst for social change: A framework, paper presented at a post-conference “Strengthening Communication for Social Justice Through Education and Research” of the 2024 Annual Conference of International Association of Communication, Brisbane, Australia. 
2. Zhang, W, (June 20, 2024).
