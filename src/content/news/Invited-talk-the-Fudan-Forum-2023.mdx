This is the third year in a row that our lab director, Prof Weiyu Zhang, is invited to present at the Fudan Forum, one of the flagship communication research events held in China. In this talk, Prof Zhang focused on the moral values demonstrated by Large-Language Models such as ChatGPT. While using human judgements (i.e., moral foundation dictionaries) as the golden standard, ChatGPT judgements show deviances that may reflect the biases inherent in the training data.
