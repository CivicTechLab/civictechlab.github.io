Dr. Weiyu Zhang joined a panel “From mini publics to maxi publics” at the D³ Congress (Online Congress on Digital Democracy) to present the Online Deliberation Singapore project. Along with experts from Czech Republic, Finland, and Germany, the panel discusses how to scale high-quality deliberation with digital means. Dr Zhang made the following suggestions for the digital turn of the Deliberation Wave:

- Random sampling of population supplemented by purposive sampling of minority groups,
- Leveraging existing technology (e.g., Zoom),
- Integrating outcomes of online deliberation into institution of policy making
