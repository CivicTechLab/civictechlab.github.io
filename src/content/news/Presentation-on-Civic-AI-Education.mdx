Dr. Weiyu Zhang delivered a presentation on “Civic AI Education: Embedding Civic Values in Learning Computer Science” at the “NUS Symposium on Artificial Intelligence Education”. AI Education has focused on advancing technologies but lagged in embedding civic values in the learning. Civic AI Education highlights the procedure leading to the AI outcomes, by centering on a deliberation framework that emphasizes the participation of diverse citizens who embrace civic values in the entire process of AI design, implementation and monitoring. The topics covered in Civic AI Education include, but are not limited to, data privacy, data security, transparent AI, explainable AI, AI fairness (or biases), and AI auditing.
