With our industry partner [TrueScope](https://www.truescope.com/campaign/media-intelligence-singapore-2?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAy9msBhD0ARIsANbk0A-tbVroUqe6wO7pUrkn7gnwUVO5Wt0hSKWRnwbaGlG2tr0lzqQFoSIaAoCYEALw_wcB), "Demystifying Portrayals of Harmful Content on YouTube and TikTok" has just been released! Through monitoring for 1-month period, we found persistent harmful content in terms of suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders. Coded hashtags and keywords were used to make the harmful content identifiable & searchable. Acronyms, misspelling, euphemisms, and hijacking famous objects are common techniques. To create harmful content, users on both platforms utilized music and video cuts. YouTube users employed more animations and music while TikTok users more coded language or images.
