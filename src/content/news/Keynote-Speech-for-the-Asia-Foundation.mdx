In this keynote address for [The Asia Foundation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-asia-foundation/) online event, 𝗔𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 𝗦𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁 [#𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=inclusive&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6999192501983084544) 𝗖𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗔𝘀𝗶𝗮, Prof Weiyu Zhang used the evolving [#tracetogether](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=tracetogether&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6999192501983084544) technology to illustrate the need to involve citizens (non-experts) in [#smartcity](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=smartcity&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6999192501983084544) initiatives. Dr Zhang made the following three major points:

1.   Smart cities are not smart if they are not inclusive. This is not just a moral judgment. It is a practical strategy.

2.   Being inclusive means including people starting from the problem formulation stage. The majority and minority groups have different views on what the problem is.

3.   Let us use the two-step [#deliberation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=deliberation&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6999192501983084544) method to be inclusive. Local CSOs such as the Penang Women’s Development Corporation are already doing the first step!
