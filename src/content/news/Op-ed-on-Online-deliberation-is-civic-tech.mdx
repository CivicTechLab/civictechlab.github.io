In this op-ed, Dr. Weiyu Zhang argues that “Deliberation needs to be both a means and an end to designing civic technologies. As a means, civic technologists can learn about how citizens understand a piece of technology through deliberation; as an end, only technological design that has involved citizens in a deliberative process can have their social legitimacy. Deliberation should be central in not only discussing but also designing critical technologies such as gene editing and artificial intelligence.”
