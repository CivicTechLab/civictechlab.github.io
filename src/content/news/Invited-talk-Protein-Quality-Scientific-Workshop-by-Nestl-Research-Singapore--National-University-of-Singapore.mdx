Together with Food Scientists from the industry and the academy, our lab director, Prof Weiyu Zhang, delivered a talk on how to communicate about Novel Food to the public located in the Asian region. In the talk, Prof Zhang emphasized the following two points:

1. Why “consumers” are not enough - Consumption is not everything; Public opinion and policies can shape consumption; People interact with each other to form opinions
2. Differences between experts vs. the public - Scientific evidence vs. personal experience; Rational vs. Emotional; Balance risks and benefits vs. avoid risks
