2024 marks the 30th anniversary of China’s Internet. 2024 is also the 100th anniversary of Louis Cha’s birth year. Our lab director Prof Weiyu Zhang delivered a talk about China’s online fandom in Hong Kong University’s Louis Cha Seminar Series on transcultural fandom. The evolvement of China’s online fandom is only one facet of this epic time. Compared to other facets, the passion, the sorrow, the anger, and the affective intensity fans attach to their fandom have special meanings. Their choices of transcultural fan objects keep begging the questions – why do they choose to be a fan? what does the choice say about a contemporary time when everyone is a fan of something?
