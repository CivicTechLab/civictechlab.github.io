On 12 July 2025, the National University of Singapore proudly hosted the IAMCR Pre-Conference marking the 50th Anniversary of the Communication Policy & Technology (CP\&T) Section—one of IAMCR’s oldest and most vibrant communities. 

Held at the Department of Communications and New Media and co-organized with the CivicTech Lab, CP\&T, and Global Media & Policy working group, the event brought together scholars and policy practitioners across five generations and six continents.

The day opened with a witty and forward-looking welcome by Dean Lionel Wee, setting the tone for honest and hopeful conversations about the past, present, and future of communication policy.

The first panel featured founding and leading voices in the field—Cees Hamelink, Robin Mansell, Rohan Samarajiva, Hopeton Dunn, Francesca Musiani, and Julia Pohle—who reflected on persistent power asymmetries and the evolving role of scholarship in shaping policy.

The second panel spotlighted Asia-Pacific perspectives, with contributions from Peng Hwa Ang, Yu-li Liu, Jonathon Hutchinson, and Hong Yu, emphasizing regional innovations and challenges.

A third panel on AI governance included international voices like Tarja Turtia and Jingbo Huang, alongside local experts Jungpil Hahn and Han Ei Chew, addressing algorithmic accountability and digital futures.

Two additional panels showcased cutting-edge research, with exciting publication ideas already in motion.

The local team—Renyi Hong, Jun Yu, and Weiyu Zhang—are proud of organizing this milestone event. The work continues, and so will the conversation. Stay tuned via CivicTech Lab for upcoming videos and next steps!
