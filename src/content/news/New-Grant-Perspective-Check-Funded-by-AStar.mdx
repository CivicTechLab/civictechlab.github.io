The project, Perspective Check, uses a ‚Äúwhole of community + AI‚Äù approach to monitor and counter harmful online content in Singapore. 

By combining AI-driven tools with insights from local communities, policymakers, and content creators, we aim to develop multi-language, multi-modal solutions to detect and address harmful content online.

This initiative is a step towards safer digital spaces and stronger, more inclusive communities. Stay tuned for updates!
