At Inter-Asia Cultural Studies Conference 2025, Dr [Weiyu Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weiyuzhang/) joined [Chih-ming Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chih-ming-wang-70607840/), [Dingkun Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dingkun-wang-1897901b0/) and Patrick Chenglong Zhou in a panel on Translating Contemporary Chineseness. The session brought together four distinct yet interconnected takes on how Chineseness is articulated, mediated, and received across global and local contexts.

From Chih-Ming Wang’s theorization of “the Chinese contemporary” to Dingkun Wang’s exploration of informal audiovisual translation, from Patrick Zhou’s analysis of audience counter-readings of Mulan to Weiyu Zhang’s computational study of Liziqi’s global reception, the panel showcased how translating Chineseness—broadly conceived—functions as a method to understand identity work, cultural circulation, and geopolitical tensions in and beyond China.
