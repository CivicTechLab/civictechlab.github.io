The International Association for Media and Communication Research - IAMCR - is the preeminent worldwide professional organization in the field of media and communication research.

The Communication Policy & Technology (CP\&T) Section of the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR) celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2025 with a special pre-conference event. As one of the oldest and largest sections of IAMCR, CP\&T aims to commemorate the evolution of communication policy research, enhance participation, and foster collaboration among members. This event brings together scholars and policy practitioners from diverse regions and different generations to deliberate on the past, the present, and the future of communication policy and technology.  

#### Background

The 50th year anniversary conference provides a platform for reflection on the CP\&T’s achievements and contributions to its field. It fosters intellectual exchange among members, encourages the sharing of cutting-edge research, and highlights the association's influence over the years. The conference also honors the evolution of academic thought and the role of the association in advancing scholarship, education, and policy.
Additionally, it strengthens the community, inspires future directions for research and collaboration, and sets a vision for the next 50 years, celebrating both heritage and innovation.

The conference calls for submissions that answer the following themes:

* Historical development of communication and media policies in diverse regions and countries;
* Policies and debates around recent and future communication technologies, including big data, AI, metaverse, blockchain, 5G, IPv6, etc.;
* Global media and communication governance (e.g., the UN Internet Governance Forum; Digital Compact) and their impacts;
* National and regional policy initiatives, e.g.  China's Belt and Road Initiative, ASEAN Plan of Action on Science, Technology and Innovation (APASTI), the Digital Service Act / Digital Market Act in the EU, etc.;
* Comparative analysis of different policy regimes (e.g. trade policies and the resulting tensions between countries such as China and the US), their implementations and implications for communication and media practices;
* Policies and debates related to technological challenges such as digital divide, disinformation, online harassment, hate speech, etc.;
* The roles played by citizens, communities and organizations (both locally and globally) in shaping communication and media policies.

The organizing team is in contact with academic journals and intends to publish at least one Special
Issue.
