This is our second year in the row to be invited to present at the Fudan Forum on “All-Media Global Communication”. In 2022, Dr. Weiyu Zhang shared the series of studies on “social media analysis of the Covid-19 vaccination discussions” the lab has worked on. This study series includes topic modeling analysis, sentiment analysis, and moral foundation analysis. The moral foundation analysis includes both English and Chinese languages. Data sources include CrowdTangle and Twitter Developer Platform.
