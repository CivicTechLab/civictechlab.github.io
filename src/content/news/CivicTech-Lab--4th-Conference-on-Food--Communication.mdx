The 4th Conference on Food & Communication at Université de Lille was an energizing experience for the Civic Tech Lab. This was our second time joining the gathering, and it strengthened our conviction that the conversation around food and communication needs to travel to Asia, where food is deeply tied to heritage, community, and the future of sustainability.

A key insight we shared: food discourse is as important as food itself. Drawing on ten years of Facebook public discussions around alternative proteins, our presentation highlighted how narratives, debates, and moral framings shape what societies consider acceptable, ethical, or desirable to eat. Food innovation is never only about technology—it is also about communication.

Our thanks go to the Food Communication Conference committee and the local hosting team at Université de Lille for their thoughtful planning and warm hospitality. The conference has become a vital space for connecting research on food, media, and democracy, and we look forward to contributing to its future growth.
