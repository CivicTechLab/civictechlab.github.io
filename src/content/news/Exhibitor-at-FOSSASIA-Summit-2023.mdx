The Civic Tech Lab is an exhibitor at [#FOSSASIA](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=fossasia&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7052115844436291585) Summit 2023. We brought a voice project "FOSS & ME" to this in-person event. Â With the support of visiting PhD students Dong Wang and Tianchan Mao, "FOSS & ME" project hosted 20 story-tellers at [#FOSSASIA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOSSASIA?src=hashtag_click) Summit 2023! A quick review of the participants shows that their ages range from 19 to 67, and 12 of them are "local" (residing in Singapore).
