As part of Prof Weiyu Zhang’s visiting professorship at Nanjing University, she delivered a talk on her 20-year academic journey to students and colleagues from her alma mater. The talk, titled “Departing is arriving: An academic journey from self to world to self”, started from Prof Zhang’s master's thesis and PhD dissertation. The talk discussed two intrinsic motivations of academic research: understanding the self, understanding the world. Prof Zhang also discussed the certainties and uncertainties of the academic profession, the identity of being academics, and the position of academia in the complicated world.
