"Taste Tomorrow: Co-Creating the Future of Food in Singapore" is a deliberative co-design workshop open to the public. The workshop has a unique way of presenting information to the attendees, followed by a small-group deliberation through discussing novel food label design decisions. In Volume. 2, We had four 10-minute talks from a science historian, a food scientist, a chef, and a taste profiling company CEO.![](/a6ceb821-6df0-407d-bf76-521f13316d8c.jpeg)

Our co-design sessions focused on exchanging perceptions of tastes and discuss about the design of a taste rating lable that will creatively and accurately indicate the taste of future foods.

Last but not least, we want to thank our collaborators Prof Ang Wee Han and his "flavor catalyst" grant for their generous support! We look forward to more such partnerships in the near future!
